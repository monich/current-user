Usage: current-user [-g GID] PROG [args]

Runs the specified program under the current Sailfish OS user
account. Obviously, current-user itself has to be launched with
root privileges, which are dropped before loading the target
program. The target program gets access to the session D-Bus,
can show the UI, access DConf and otherwise behave as if it was
launched as a part of the user session.

Most notably, it allows programs which require access to user
session specific things, to be activated by D-Bus with a system
bus call, e.g. from a system service.
